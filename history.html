              <p class="westminsterExplanation">Westminster Abbey is a church located within the heart of London.
                The Gothic Church was first built in 960 AD, and was later rebuilt during the rule of Henry III
                in the 13th Century. The most noteable aspect of Westminster Abbey would be its complex and beautiful
                architecture with things such as stained glass windows, towering spires, and the detail in each stone
                carving. Westminster Abbey is well known for hosting a variety of important occasions for Britain's 
                royal family. Some of these events include coronations, weddings, and funerals. 
              </p> 
              <p class="westminsterExplanation">To add to its royal significance, the church also serves as the final
                resting place for a wide range of noteable figures throughout British history. Aside from members of
                the royal family, other figures include statesmen like Winston Churchill, poets like Geoffery Chaucer,
                and scientists like Isaac Newton.

                in mind that there are some services throughout the year that occur on an invitation-only basis,
                meaning tickets would need to be booked in advance.

              <p class="buckinghamExplanation">Buckingham Palace serves as the official place of residence
                for the British monarchy, as well as an adminstrative space for the royal family as a whole.
                The palace was originally built in 1703 during the time of the Duke of Buckingham, and eventually
                became a home for the royal family in 1837 for Queen Victoria's reign. Buckingham Palace has gone 
                through numerous upgrades and expansions over the decades. One of the most noteable ones would be
                the grand balcony where the royal family stands and greets the crowd during major events. To 
                add to the palace's adminstrative purposes, it serves as the host for many state functions and
                ceremonial events throughout the year. 
              </p>
              <p class="buckinghamExplanation">The palace becomes an exceptionally popular tourist extraction 
                during the summer months because that is the time when certain areas of the palace are open to 
                the public. One particularily popular sight tourists enjoy would be the Changing of the Guard Ceremony,
                which has become a staple in British royal culture.

              <p class="cathedralExplanation">St. Paul's Cathedral serves as one of the most iconic landmarks in all of 
                London. The church, which is highly regarded for its complex architecture and artistry, was built by
                Sir Christopher Wren in 1710 after the first church was destroyed during the Great Fire of London. 
                The cathedral perfectly encapsulates the Baroque style with its grand dome, mosaics, and sculptures.
              </p>
              <p class="cathedralExplanation">The cathedral has also been the site of a wide range of notable
                events in British history. Some of these include the wedding of then Prince Charles and Lady
                Diana Spencer, peace services to mark the end of World Wars I and II, Jubilee celebrations, 
                as well as the funerals for British figures such as Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, 
                and Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother. When tourists go to visit, they can see the Golden 
                Gallery to experience a brand new and unique view of London. 
              </p>

              <h3>Additional Details About a St. Paul's Cathedral Tour</h3>
              <p class="cathedralExplanation">Vistors are able to make their way down to the crypt in order
                to get a closer look at the resting place and memorials for some of Britain's greatest 
                figures. 
              </p>
              <p class="cathedralExplanation">Another area of interest would be the Stone and Gold galleries,
                which provides guests with additional breathtaking views of London. Visits inside the 
                Stone and Gold Galleries and dependent on availability.

              <h3>Are Visitors Allowed to Attend Church Services?</h3>
              <p class="cathedralExplanation">Because St. Paul's is an active place of worship, all visitors
                all welcome to attend a service for free. The services include morning service, holy communion, 
                eucharist, and evensong. In addition to regular church services, the cathedral hosts a number of
                special services throughout the year. In such scenarios, tickets must be booked in advance.

              <p class="towerExplanation">London's Tower Bridge is a suspension bridge that goes over 
                the River Thames. The bridge was built in 1894, and its main purpose was to try and mitigate
                the heavy amounts of traffic, while also giving ships a space to pass through to the busy
                port in London. The great Victorian-styled twin towers of the brige stand tall and serve 
                as a reminder of London's rich history in engineering progress. Because the roadways of 
                the bridge can be raised up high, bigger ships are also able to pass through to the ports.
              </p>
              <p class="towerExplanation">Those who visit the Tower Bridge can take part in an interactive
                tour that gives a meanigful insight about the history and engineering of the bridge by
                getting the opportunity to walk through the Towers and Engine Rooms. 
                During the tour, visitors can go to the high-level walkways that provide an excellent view
                of the River Thames and the skyline of the surrounding area.
