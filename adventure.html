              <h2>Jack The Ripper Walking Tour</h2>
              <h5>Address: 88 Whitechapel High St, London E1 7RA, United Kingdom</h5>

            <div class="ripperParagraph">
              <p class="ripperExplanation">The Jack the Rippper Walking Tour that details the chilling crime 
                of the famous unmasked serial killer that made his way through the dark streets and alleyways of London in 1888.
                The tour begins on Whitechapel High Street and ends at Spitalfields. Guests are guided down a 
                series of dark streets and pinpoint the exact location of five of Jack the Ripper's murders, two of the most
                infamous ones being that of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes.
                There, they will hear about victim testimonies, evidence surrounding each case, and theories 
                that try to uncover who Jack the Ripper really was. A tour of this nature shines a light on some of the 
                more dark and somber aspects of London's history.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>How Much Do Tickets Cost?</h3>
              <p class="ripperExplanation">Guests can purchase tickets for the tour starting at £15.00 via 
                <a href="https://www.jack-the-ripper-tour.com/how-to-book/" target="_blank">the official Jack the Ripper Walking Tour website </a>
                so they can find a time and date that works best for them.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>What Time Do The Tours Happen?</h3>
              <p class="ripperExplanation">The selected public tours start at 7:00pm, and they usually last for 
                about 1 hour and 30 minutes. It is important to arrive at your time slot at least 15-20 minutes 
                before the tour is scheduled to start.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>Can Children Come on the Tour?</h3>
              <p class="ripperExplanation">It is generally discouraged for children to come on the walking tour.
                This is due to the nature of the cases and the fact that they all contain details that are 
                graphic and disturbing, which can be scary and distressing for children. That being said, children
                over the age of 12 are allowed to go on the tour, but it is simply advised for parents to use 
                discretion to determine whether or not their child will be able to handle it.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>Are People Allowed to Take Photographs?</h3>
              <p class="ripperExplanation">Yes, photography is allowed along the tour route. Because the tour
                takes place at night, the atmosphereic dark streets create an mysterious look among the different
                historical sites, which visitors love to capture in their photos. That being said, because of the 
                natuure of the crimes committed in each location, it is important for tourists to maintain
                respect while passing through.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>Does the Tour Involve Entering the Buildings?</h3>
              <p class="ripperExplanation">No, tourists do not go inside any of the sites marked along
                the tour. Because the Jack the Ripper tour is an outdoor tour, tourists will be guided 
                in front of each building and be presented with a series of background information 
                involving each spot.

              <p class="dareExplanation">The Dare Skywalk provides tourists with an exhilerating aerial view 
                of the city. This experience takes place 46 meters off the ground, and participants make their 
                way on a glass walkway. From these heights, they are able to get a completely panoramic view 
                of some of London's most iconic landmarks such as Canary Wharf, the River Thames, and the Shard. 
                There is no need for guests to feel uneasy being so high in the sky because these tours are 
                guided by highly trained professionals. Additionally, they are provided with all of the necessary 
                safety gear for the climb. For those who are feeling extremely daring, the Dare Skywalk provides
                opportunities where they can skydive from the top down to the bottom.

              <br>

              <h3>Is Climbing Experience Needed to Participate?</h3>

                to visit and participate at the Dare Skywalk. Participants can be as young as 
                8-years-old and is doable for all despite their level of fitness.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>How Long Does the Dare Skywalk Experience Take?</h3>
              <p class="dareExplanation">The entire session lasts for about 90 minutes. Before visitors 
                climb to the top, they must participate in a safety session to understand what they and 
                the instructor needs to do in case of an emergency. The walking part of the tour takes
                around 45 minutes, but this can vary depending on the weather conditions, pace of the 
                entire group, and any other outside circumstances that may arise during the climb.

              <h3>What Should People Wear to the Dare Skywalk?</h3>
              <p class="dareExplanation">It is highly recommended that guests wear shoes that are 
                comfortable and made for walking for long periods of time. Because the walk takes 
                place so far off the ground, guests should also dress appropriately for the weather 
                by wearing long pants and a sweatshirt or jacket of sorts. Clothing items like skirts,
                sandals, or heeled shoes should be avoided.

              <p class="crystalMazeExplanation">Based on the popular TV show from the 90s,
                the Crystal Maze LIVE Experience gives guests the opportunity to feel as 
                though they are actually participating in the show. They are guided by a Maze Master
                and must travel through the four time zones: Aztec, Industrial, Medieval, and Futuristic.
                As they travel through time, they will endue a series of timed mental and physical challenges
                that they must complete to progress through the game by collecting crystals. This vibrant 
                experience is perfect for groups of families or friends as it is a very team-oriented activity.
                Even if people have never seen the show before, this experience serves as the perfect opportunity
                to be exposed to something new that tests their mental fortitude and agility.
