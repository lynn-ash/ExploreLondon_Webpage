# ExploreLondon_Webpage
In order to get more practice using HTML and CSS, and get an introduction to JavaScript and PHP, I have created a simple tourist information website for the city of London. My main goal with this project was to simply apply the web design and development skills I have acquired so far from my classes.

This website focuses on the city of London, and provides tourists with a information ranging from transportation/travel recommendations, different types of foods and attractions, and a section for freuquently asked questions that travelers have about the city.
