              <h2>The British Museum</h2>
              <h5>Address: Great Russell St, London WC1B 3DG, United Kingdom</h5>
              <img src="culturePictures/britishMuseumPic.jpg" class="britishMuseumPic">

            <div class="britishMuseumParagraph">
              <p class="britishMuseumExplanation">The British Museum is home to some of the most priceless 
                pieces displaying history and culture from all over the world. The museum was founded in 1753,
                and since that time has managed to capture approximately 2 million years worth of history.
                Some of its collections include the tombs of mummies from ancient Egypt, statues of important
                Roman and Greek figures, as well as different tools from different continents around the world 
                that help depict their means of operation and evolution. One of the most iconic artifacts in the 
                British Musuem would be the Rosetta stone, which contains writings in multiple different writing 
                styles. This helped historians understand how to read and understand hieroglyphs. This goes to 
                show that the vast amount of history packed inside the musuem could have guests exploring it 
                all day long.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>Is The British Museum Free to The Public?</h3>
              <p class="britishMuseumExplanation">Yes, visitors do not have to pay a fee in order to enjoy the museum.
                That being said, because the museum can get extremely busy, they must book a timed entry ticket in 
                advance to ensure that they will actually be able to get inside. People can also try and get these 
                tickets when they come straight to the museum, but entry may not be guarenteed. 
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>Are There Places to Eat Inside of the British Museum?</h3>
              <p class="britishMuseumExplanation">There are a wide range of food spaces in the British 
                Museum that offer both light snacks and full-course meals. Each restaurant also adheres
                to a wide range of dietary restrictions that vistors may have.

              <h3>Are There Shops in the British Musuem?</h3>
              <p class="britishMuseumExplanation">The British Museum has many different gift shops scattered
                throughout the premises. There, people can souvenirs, books, and replicas of certain items 
                in the musuem.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>Can People Take Photos of the Exhibits?</h3>
              <p class="britishMuseumExplanation">Photography is allowed in most of the exhibits in the 
                museum, but the use of tripods and flash photography are absolutely prohibited. The reason 
                behind this is because flash photography can damage more delicate pieces of artwork. An example
                of this would be certain pigments of paint which can degrade over time when exposed to the flashes
                from a camera.

              <h2>The National Gallery</h2>

            <br>


            <div class="nationalParagraph">
              <p class="nationalExplanation">The National Gallery is arguably one of the most 
                well known art institutions in London. It holds 700 years of European art, 
                spanning back to its foundation in 1824. The museum includes work from some of 
                the world's greatest artists of all time such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Claude Monet,
                Rembrandt, and Vincent Van Gogh. The over 2,300 pieces of artwork in the musuem
                help show the flow of time and artstic evolution in style, technique, and overall 
                themes. The pieces range from medieval times all the way to more modern and 
                contemporary times. The National Gallery hosts a number of temporary exhibits
                throughout the year, which gives art enthusiasts with different art preferences to 
                see something they are interested in, or introduce them to something entirely 
                brand new.

              <h3>How Much is Admission Into The National Gallery?</h3>
              <p class="nationalExplanation">Entry into the National Gallery is completely free, which means 
                visitors have the freedom to explore all of the permanent exhibits the musuem has to offer without
                needing to purchase a ticket. However, there are certain temporary exhibits that may require some 
                kind of entrance fee, so it always important to check with a staff member just to be sure.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>Is Photography Allowed Inside The National Gallery?</h3>
              <p class="nationalExplanation">Photography is allowed in most areas of the National Gallery,
                but flash photography is strictly forbidden as it can cause the artwork to deteriorate 
                over time. There are certain special exhibits where photography of any kind might be 
                completely banned, so it is important to check for any signs or ask a staff member.
              </p>

              <br>

              <h3>How Long Do Visitors Spend At the National Gallery?</h3>
              <p class="nationalExplanation">The amount of time that a visitor spends at the National Gallery
                may simply depend on the level of interest they have in art. For instance, casual enjoyers 
                might spend no more than an hour or two cruising throughout the museum. However, those with a 
                much deeper and profound love and interest in art may end up spending several hours deeply 
                analyzing each exhibit.
