              <label for="question2" class="questionStyle">What is the best time of year to visit?</label>
              <ul class="answer">
                <p>This is purely based on the preferences of the traveler. There are plenty of benefits for traveling
                   in either the winter or summer months. </p>
                <h5 class="winterExplanation">Winter Months:</h5>
                <p>Those who choose to come during the winter will be welcomed with a cheerfully festive
                  atmosphere. Because it is the holiday season, the city is decked out in all sorts of bright
                  lights, decorations, and Christmas trees. The best areas to see these would be places such as
                  Oxford Street, Regent Street, or Convent Garden. This is also the time of year to experience the
                  wonders of traditional Christmas markets. These markets are stocked with delicious treats, handcrafted
                  gifts, and different wines. There is also the benefit of smaller crowds, which provides a quiter atmosphere
                  and makes it easier to get into major tourist attractions such as the British Museum, Buckingham Palace, or
                  the Tower of London.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>The atmosphere also allows for quite the xozy experience. Because the weather is so cold outside,
                  tourists can enjoy a series of different indoor treats. For instance, London has a wide range of 
                  historic cozy pubs and cafes. There, tourists can enjoy the hearty British atmosphere and hot drinks
                  all while relaxing next to a sizzling fireplace. 
                </p>

                <br>
                <h5 class="summerExplanation">Summer Months:</h5>
                <p>Because the weather is so warm, there are plenty of outdoor activites for tourists to choose from.
                  For instance, the outdoor theaters such as Shakespeare's Golden Theatre or Regent Park's Open Air Theatre
                   give people the opportunity to experience their favorite classical plays being brought to life. In addition 
                   to that, these months are when music festivals start happening. Some popular ones include the British Summer
                   Time Hyde Park or Lovebox Festival. The weather also draws people towards the many blooming gardens London
                   has to offer. Place such as Kew Gardens, Hyde Park, and St. James's Park serve as the perfect places to take
                   in the vibrant and colorful scenery all while enjoying a nice picnic.
                </p>
                <p>For those who enjoy a more lively atmosphere, London becomes the central hub for tourists when it comes to
                  shopping, dining, and sightseeing. It is during these months that outdoor dining makes a return, which allows
                  tourists to take in some fresh air all while enjoying their meal.

                 in for first-time visitors?</label>
              <ul class="answer">
                <p>This depends on the number of people traveling, as well as the type of experience tourists are trying
                  to get out of their stay. For exampele, to experience a family-friendly experience, areas such as somewhere like Kensington would
                  be ideal due to the lovely parks, and its proximity to attractions like the Natural History Musuem. 
                </p>
                <p>Central London (Zones 1-2) areas such as Covent Garden, Westminster, and Mayfair are good for those who
